## 🔍 Project Highlights

### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
- Sourced datasets from the **World Bank Open Data** platform.  
- Performed **data wrangling**, **normalization**, and **missing value handling** using `pandas` and `numpy`.  
- Applied **feature engineering** to create meaningful indicators such as GDP per capita and health expenditure ratios.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Conducted **statistical summaries**, **correlation analysis**, and **trend exploration**.  
- Compared regional patterns of life expectancy with economic and healthcare variables.  
- Combined **explorative** and **explanatory** approaches to identify and communicate key insights.

### **3. Data Visualization & Storytelling**
- Developed **interactive and static visualizations** using `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `plotly`.  
- Focused on **clarity**, **accessibility**, and **data-driven storytelling** for both technical and non-technical audiences.  
- Designed visuals that highlight socio-economic contrasts and long-term global health trends.

### **4. Insights & Interpretation**
- Showcases global inequalities in life expectancy and their relationships to economic and social factors.  
- Demonstrates the power of **data visualization** for communicating complex insights effectively.  
- Emphasizes evidence-based reasoning and interpretability.
