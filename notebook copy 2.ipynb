    "Our project focuses on studying global life expectancy, with a specific emphasis on Japan. To explore and explain life expectancy from various angles, we have utilized multiple data sources. We chose this topic because it lends itself well to comprehensive analysis and greatly interests many people. Understanding which factors contribute to a longer life is a common curiosity individuals share worldwide. In addition, the topic is broad and offers a temporal element (the development through time) that could be explored and explained through visual representations. Using a statistical approach and examining data across time and space, we could create engaging visualizations that enhance the storytelling aspect of our project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal was to examine both the economic, social and lifestyle factors that influence life expectancy and also to give the reader an idea of the development of life expectancy globally. To achieve this, we gathered data from sources such as the World Bank, the World Health Organization (WHO), the United Nations, OECD, the human mortality database, and various other independent sources, including Wikipedia. The World Bank provided population data, GDP, and health expenditure information for different countries over the years. WHO data includes life expectancy and cause of death statistics across countries and years. The United Nations was used to find data on countries' diets and meat consumption, while OECD data provided insights into daily activities based on nationality. So we had data both to cover a broad range of factors that influence life expectancy, and also to provide a historical perspective on the development of life expectancy globally.\n",

    "Our article aimed to create an informative and captivating reading experience. We wanted to combinate much relevant information into one story, such that the reader would be able to both learn something about history and also be able to reflect on their own life and how they can improve their chances of living a long life. Our primary focus was to make the article accessible and understandable to a broad audience, combining readability with engaging visuals to provide an enjoyable reading experience."

    "\n",
    "1. [The WHO data on life expectancy for countries over time](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ulrikthygepedersen/life-expectancy?fbclid=IwAR0JO7W1_G3prS0O48OITDxvSeQPm64MtaUOIbfNjBCzcHttAUh_tC3xJME)\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is clean from the beginning and consists of 4 columns. The first column is a short-hand code for the country's name; the second column is the country's name, the third column is the year, and the fourth column is the life expectancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has no missing values and is easy to use. We use this data to plot the development of life expectancy over time for different countries on a global map.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [The World Bank data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?fbclid=IwAR2Jf_Asqt1WWMuQ_S1bobud8Q36WcVEYDx4lF0RrdCprmiESBD0yyNaGDk)\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the GDP and Health datasets. For both datasets, we did the same preprocessing. The data contains values for years and countries about GDP or health expenditure in dollars per capita.\n",
    "This data is less clean. There are a lot of NaN values which we have excluded. We preprocess this dataset by combining it with the WHO dataset to get a new dataset with 4 columns, year, country,life expectancy and GDP/Health expenditure.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [The UN data](https://www.populationpyramid.net/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is what is used to make the population pyramid plots. Each CSV file we got from here represents one country in one year. The data simply consists of 3 columns, age group, amount males and amount females. The only preprocessing that was necessary here was to combine the number of males and females into 1 column, as we decided not to focus on the difference between male and female in this scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [the OECD data](https://ourworldindata.org/time-use)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is used to plot the time spent on daily activities. The data is clean from the beginning and consists of 3 columns, country, activity, and percentage of people doing the activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [WHO data on obesity rate, daily caloric intake, prevalence of insufficient physical activity and suicide rate](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main)\n",
    "\n",
    "For these 4 indicators, we used the most recently available data. For obesity and suicice rates this meant data from year 2016, whereas data from 2019 and 2018 was downloaded for prevalence of insufficient physical activity among adults and daily caloric supply, respectively. These data came clean without NaNs and, thus, did not require further preprocessing. The data files simply include two columns; a country column and the value of the indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. [Cause-specific mortality rates for Germany, Italy, US and Japan data from WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-leading-causes-of-death)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes clean without NaNs in Excel files for the individual countries. We only kept the 90th percentile of data for each country to visualize that information as the top 10% most common death causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. [Meat consumption data from UN FAO - downloaded from OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production)\n",
    "\n",
    "This data originates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and was obtained via OurWorldinData. The data is clean and did not require further preprocessing before visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. [The Human Mortality Database](https://www.lifetable.de/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This website is comprehensive but also by far the messiest to make good use of. Here we obtain the life tabless data tables that can be used to calculate life expectancy and conditioned life expectancy (e.g., given you are this old, how long can you expect to live). This data is used in the \"chance of surviving to this age\" plot and the plot with the oldest human. For each country, they found sources covering intervals in years that you can check up on. So, for example, some sources may contain data from only every 5 years in some intervals, while other intervals every year, and some years no data at all. In addition, it is very rare for less developed countries to have any sources that go further back in time than the year 2000. The preprocessing consisted of finding a reliable source for each country and year intervals and hopefully finding enough to more or less cover the entire span of 1960 to 2020. (else we simply did linear interpolation between the years we know). The dataset also comes with many other features that had to be sorted out and were separated into male and female, which we simply combined into one category. To give an idea of the chaos of the data, the code for producing the \"change of surviving to this age\" is listed below. (note we could not just do a general loop for each country and year, as the features vary from dataset to dataset)\n",

    "From the beginning, we knew we wanted a world map of life-expectancy development for all countries. This would, for the reader, serve as an eye-catcher and an excellent broad way to start the article, while for us, the writers, provide a high-level idea of exciting things to investigate further on. As a matter of fact, we needed to figure out how to focus on Japan before this point even. Then we saw how the life expectancy in Japan actually seemed quite outlying and decided to focus on it. Some interesting observations from this exploratory phase were how life expectancy had improved dramatically in China and, in general, how the world has become more equal in terms of life expectancy, as particularly Africa has a much higher life expectancy now than in 1960.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make it easier to understand how much these countries have changed, we also made an interactive barplot that compares their life-expectancy from 1960 to 2020. Having a barplot like this makes comparison easier than having to look at the whole world map, which, however, provides for a more holistic and aesthetic experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, we decided to look more into the distribution of how long people live rather than just having the life expectancy. This gave rise to the \"chance of surviving to this age\" plot. From this plot, we learned that there are specific characteristics that differentiate the developing countries from the developed countries. Notably, the high mortality rate was apparent from this plot. Moreover, the death rate is closer to linear in developing countries, while in developed countries, it is first flat (almost no one dies before age 50) and then starts to fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "This discrepancy, we thought, would give rise to different population pyramid structures. So we decided to look into that. Here we also saw a difference, which we made an interactive plot in order for us and the reader to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we wanted to know and show if there is a connection between GDP, Health Expenditure and life expectancy. To do this, we plotted GDP and Health Expenditure against life expectancy for different years. We intuitively understood there was a connection from looking at the scatter plot, but it did not show a linear trend. So we transformed the x-axis into log-space (semi-log plot), and here we saw quite the appropriate fit. So we fitted a linear function in this semilog-space and got a pretty nice fit from eye-balling the plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we decided to transform the data (and regression line) back into a regular (not logarithmic) plot. We thought it looked better and was perhaps easier to grasp for the non-scientific reader. Indeed, we also did this same plot for different years than 2019, but we decided only to include the plot for 2019 on the website, as it alone conveyed the message we were interested in. Including the data from years other than 2019 makes the plot messier and harder to read, and the message is mostly the same. \n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting point we saw when looking at the plots from 1960 and 1990 instead of only 2019 is that the logistic regression slope was higher back then. In other words, the GDP and Health Expenditure were predicted to continue to improve life-expectancy without flattening out after awhile. This is probably due to the fact that the life expectancy was much lower back then, and the effect of GDP and Health Expenditure is more prominent when the life expectancy is lower. In addition, some countries now have an incredibly high GDP, but it does not represent the actual 'richness' of the country because companies use these countries as tax havens. Furthermore, GDP usually only considers citizens of the country, so countries where many people work in other countries, but send money back to their home country, will have a lower GDP than they should have. Thus whether this observation is meaningful or whether it is just a result of GDP not being a perfect measure of wealth is hard to say. Indeed for Health Expenditure, we saw how the USA spends a lot even with a relatively low life expectancy. This led us to the conclusion that not only do you have to spend many resources, but you also have to spend them in the right way.\n",

    "To tell the data story of global life expectancy, we chose to follow a **magazine style** narrative genre. The reasoning behind this choice is to provide broad appeal, both visually and content-wise while delivering an informative reading experience. The reader is presented with an article that flows naturally with easily understandable language but also includes rich data visualizations that support the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Visual Narrative Tools from Segal and Heer** <br>\n",
    "For visual structuring, we aim to provide our readers a **Consistent Visual Platform**. This is seen in the visualizations where we use similar color themes for plots that are within the same category in terms of content and interactivity. Moreover, all the content is on a single page. All that the user needs to do is to scroll down, a gesture that is familiar to most readers and is, thus, in line with our goal of having a broad appeal while providing narrative continuity. There is no need to switch pages. All you do is simply scroll. For the interactive visualizations, readers can get **close-ups** of the data, navigate the **distinctive features**, and **zooming** in on the ones that they find most interesting. In the very beginning, we have chosen to include a large map of life expectancy over time across the world. The idea was to provide a visually catchy introduction to capture and retain the reader's attention from the very beginning of the narrative. This map provides **animated transitions** through time in **motion** for life expectancy, over time, for the entire world and provides an excellent overview of the temporal aspect in an aesthetically pleasing and informative manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative Structure Tools from Segal and Heer** <br>\n",
    "While the ordering of our article is thought to be **linear**, certain sections are still readable independently from each other. This is due to certain choices we have made with narrative structuring. Generally, the article can be divided into 4 main parts with the appropriate **Captions / Headlines**. First, it begins with an **Introductory Text** that introduces the main topics and questions that the article will explore. Second, we cover global life expectancy. Third, we zoom in on Japan for the narrative focus. And finally, we provide a **Summary** of the answers that were found. The aforementioned sections can be read independently from each other in terms of ordering, despite the intention being from top to bottom in a linear way. Throughout the article, we include sources along with the **Accompanying Articles** for everything that is written and annotations on plots so they are made even more intuitive. The interactive plots all have **Stimulating Default Views**, where the reader can **Hover** over the data and get an extra layer of information while also being able to **Highlight/filter** the shown data for the bar charts, specifically. We also include visualizations with **Very Limited Interactivity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Narrative Reflections**\n",
    "While the narrative mainly remains author-driven, we introduce reader-driven elements through interactive visualizations. Consequently, our data story does have elements from the **Interactive Slideshow structure** since free interactivity is incorporated mid-narrative within the confines of the respective sections. Hence, readers can explore specific aspects of the content/data before moving on to the next part of the story when they are ready to do so. The individual slides would, in our case, be the sections that follow the **Martini Glass structure**, where the author-intended messaging is communicated before the user is presented with the option to explore interactively."
